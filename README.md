# Eml2mbox
A script to convert eml files from various email export systems into an mbox file to be imported inside Thunderbird Apple Mail etc.

## Need
While gmail and other major email service providers let us export directly into an mbox folder, most webmail systems exports emails into a zip folder containing a bunch of eml files.
Apple Mail, Thunderbird etc imports mailboxes rather than single email files. This email client are the best option to keep our email archive organized and searchable.
Single eml files are usually named after the original email subject. Content is usually not indexed and these files need to be opened one by one.

## Starting point (2021-05-26)
Starting from a gist found on github (Kadin - kadin2048)[https://gist.github.com/kadin2048/c332a572a388acc22d56] I'll try to test if the script works, bring it to python3 and add more features.
